code for Graph Intelligence Enhanced Bi-Channel Insider Threat Detection paper
This CERT4.2 dataaset is huge, and also raw. It is a huge workload to preprocess and re-organize the data.CERT4.2 fold actually only includes the final small user-day graph dataset we construted to perform experiments.By running GCN_mean-upload.py (with csv files needed in the right place), one can see GCN extractor's performance and extracter inter-user feature. By running cnn-trial-cert-whole-mean-upload.py, the comparision between inner-user channel and bi-channel can be seen. By running SVM-upload.py, one can see the same comparison experiment for SVM.
If anyone wants to see how the preprocessing works, it could be done by running feature_extract_multi_final-upload.py,data_process_new_final-upload.py,generate_train_test_data_upload.py,one by one. In CERT4.2 folder, all the subfolders are for data preprocessing. There are some example file in it. Before trying preprocessing, one needs to download "device.csv" and "logon.csv" from CMU CERT reasearch center website(too big to up load to github).
